    <p>In a certain kingdom, in a certain state, there lived a rich merchant. He had a lot of all sorts of goods: precious stones, elegant fabrics and carpets, gold and silver, but his greatest wealth were his three daughters. All three are famous beauties, and the youngest daughter is the best looking, and also kind and affectionate, which is why the merchant loved her more than the others.</p>
